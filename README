Draw Lindenmayer systems using SDL + OpenGL

A Lindenmayer system (or L-system) is a parallel rewriting system and
a type of formal grammar. Here it is used to generate self-similar
fractals like the:

* Sierpinski triangle
* Sierpinski square
* von Koch snowflake
* von Koch island
* Dragon curve
* Gosper curves

and more... see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system

The subdirectory ulam contains a program that uses the same OpenGL
routines to draw an Ulam spiral (a method of visualizing prime
numbers) and the recursive subdirectory contains a program that draws
some of these fractals using recursive methods (much slower).
