Draw Lindenmayer systems using SDL + OpenGL

A Lindenmayer system (or L-system) is a parallel rewriting system and
a type of formal grammar. Here it is used to generate self-similar
fractals like:

* Sierpinski triangle and square
* von Koch snowflake and variations
* Dragon curve and variations (terdragon, double dragon)
* Penrose tilings (pentagons, kites, darts)
* Trees, plants
* Peano curves
* Gosper curves
* Kolams
* Levy curve
* Hilbert curve
* Dekking's church
* Sphinx tiling

and more... see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system

Live demo using WebGL:

 http://albertveli.github.io/ulam_sdlgl/

Source code for the demo is in the webgl subdirectory.

The subdirectory ulam contains a program that uses OpenGL to draw an
Ulam spiral (a method of visualizing prime numbers) and the recursive
subdirectory contains a program that draws some of these fractals
using recursive methods (much slower).
