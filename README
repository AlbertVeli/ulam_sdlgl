Draw Ulam Spiral using OpenGL + SDL

The Ulam spiral is a method of visualizing the prime numbers, that
reveals the apparent tendency of certain quadratic polynomials to
generate unusually large numbers of primes. It was discovered by the
mathematician Stanislaw Ulam in 1963, while he was doodling during the
presentation of a "long and very boring paper" at a scientific
meeting.

Rendered video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZGqOF_6zso

The video was rendered by first setting save_screenshots = 1 in the
source code and then using ffmpeg to assemble the screenshots into a
video file:

ffmpeg -f image2 -i "s%05d.bmp" -c:v prores -an -r 30 ulam.mov

My video editor prefers the prores codec, but you can use any video
codec ffmpeg supports, run ffmpeg -encoders to list available codecs
for video encoding.

The SDL OpenGL intialization and texture loading comes from NeHe
OpenGL lesson09 (by Jeff Molofee '99, ported to SDL by Sam Latinga
'2000).

List of primes are calculated at startup, before OpenGL
initialization.
